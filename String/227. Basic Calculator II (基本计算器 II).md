**Difficulty:** `medium`

**Tag:** `String` / `Stack`

## Question

Given a string `s` which represents an expression, *evaluate this expression and return its value*. 

------

## Solution

This problem is relatively simpler to solve, as we don't have to take care of the parenthesis. The aim is to evaluate the given mathematical expression by applying the basic mathematical rules. The expressions are evaluated from left to right and the order of evaluation depends on the <u>Operator Precedence</u>(运算符优先级).

#### Approach 1 -- Using Stack

We know that there could be 4 types of operations - addition `(+)`, subtraction `(-)`, multiplication `(*)` and division `(/)`. Without parenthesis, we know that, multiplication `(*)` and division `(/)` operations would always have higher precedence than addition `(+)` and subtraction `(-)` based on operator precedence rules.

![](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/Figures/227/calculator_overview.png)

If we look at the above examples, we can make the following observations:

- If the current operation is addition `(+)` or subtraction `(-)`, then the expression is evaluated based on the precedence of the next operation.

In example 1, `4+3` is evaluated later because the next operation is multiplication `(3*5)` which has higher precedence. But, in example 2, `4+3` is evaluated first because the next operation is subtraction `(3-5)` which has equal precedence.

- If the current operator is multiplication `(*)` or division `(/)`, then the expression is evaluated irrespective the next operation. This is because in the given set of operations `(+ - * /)`, the `*` and `/` operations have the highest precedence and therefore must be evaluated first.

In the above example 2 and 3, `4*3` is always evaluated first irrespective of the next operation.

**Algorithm:**

Scan the input string `s` from left to right and evaluate the expressions based on the following rules:

1. If the current character is a digit `0-9`, add it to the number `currentNumber`.

2. Otherwise, the current character must be an operation `(+-*/)`. Evaluate the expression based on the type of operation.

   - Addition `(+)` or Subtraction `(-)`: We must evaluate the expression later based on the next operation. So, we must store the `currentNumber` to be used later.

     > Stack data structure follows Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. Hence, the last pushed number in the stack would be popped out first for evaluation. In addition, when we pop from the stack and evaluate this expression in the future, we need a way to determine if the operation was Addition `(+)` or Subtraction `(-)`. To simplify our evaluation, we can push `-currentNumber` in a stack if the current operation is subtraction (`-`) and assume that the operation for all the values in the stack is addition `(+)`. This works because `(a - currentNumber)` is equivalent to `(a + (-currentNumber))`.

   - Multiplication `(*)` or Division `(/)`: Pop the top values from the stack and evaluate the current expression. Push the evaluted value back to the stack.

Once the string is scanned, pop from the stack and add to the `result`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int calculate(String s) {

        if (s == null || s.isEmpty()) return 0;
        int len = s.length();
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
        int currentNumber = 0;
        char operation = '+';
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            char currentChar = s.charAt(i);
            if (Character.isDigit(currentChar)) {
                currentNumber = (currentNumber * 10) + (currentChar - '0');
            }
            if (!Character.isDigit(currentChar) && !Character.isWhitespace(currentChar) || i == len - 1) {
                if (operation == '-') {
                    stack.push(-currentNumber);
                }
                else if (operation == '+') {
                    stack.push(currentNumber);
                }
                else if (operation == '*') {
                    stack.push(stack.pop() * currentNumber);
                }
                else if (operation == '/') {
                    stack.push(stack.pop() / currentNumber);
                }
                operation = currentChar;
                currentNumber = 0;
            }
        }
        int result = 0;
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            result += stack.pop();
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

##### Own Code

My codes are more complicated, because I don't consider use `-number` replaces  Subtraction.

The digital acquisition is another point need to learn.

```java
class Solution {
    public int calculate(String s) {
        s = s.replaceAll("\\s", "");
        Deque<Integer> q1 = new LinkedList<Integer>();//存储数字
        Deque<Character> q2 = new LinkedList<Character>();//存储加号和减号
        Stack<Character> s2 = new Stack<Character>();//存储乘号和除号
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '+' || s.charAt(i) == '-') {
                q2.addLast(s.charAt(i));//加号减号入栈,乘号除号直接计算
                i++;
            } else if (s.charAt(i) == '*') {
                int a = q1.removeLast();
                int j = i + 1;
                while (Character.isDigit(s.charAt(j))) {
                    j++;
                    if (j == s.length()) break;
                }
                int b = Integer.parseInt(s.substring(i + 1, j));
                q1.addLast(a * b);
                i = j;
            } else if (s.charAt(i) == '/') {
                int a = q1.removeLast();
                int j = i + 1;
               while (Character.isDigit(s.charAt(j))) {
                    j++;
                    if (j == s.length()) break;
                }
                int b = Integer.parseInt(s.substring(i + 1, j));
                q1.addLast(a / b);
                i = j;
            } else {
                int j = i;
                while (Character.isDigit(s.charAt(j))) {
                    j++;
                    if (j == s.length()) break;
                }
                int num = Integer.parseInt(s.substring(i, j));
                i = j;
                q1.addLast(num);
            }
        }
        while (!q2.isEmpty()) {
            char c = q2.remove();
            int a = q1.remove();
            int b = q1.remove();
            if (c == '+') q1.addFirst(a + b);
            if (c == '-') q1.addFirst(a - b);
        }
        return q1.getLast();
    }
}
```



#### Approach 2 -- Optimised Approach without the stack

In the previous approach, we used a stack to track the values of the evaluated expressions. In the end, we pop all the values from the stack and add to the result. Instead of that, we could add the values to the result beforehand and keep track of the last calculated number, thus eliminating the need for the stack.

**Algorithm:**

The approach works simlilar to Approach_1 with the following differences:

- Instead of using a `stack`, we use a variable `lastNumber` to track the value of the last evaluated expression.
- If the operation is Addition or Subtraction, add the `lastNumebr` to the result instead of pushing it to the stack. The `currentNumber` would be updated to `lastNumebr` for the next iteration.
- If the operation is Multiplication or Division, we must evaluate the expression `lastNumber * currentNumber` and update the `lastNumebr` with the result of the expression. This would be added to the result after the entire string is scanned.

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int calculate(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.isEmpty()) return 0;
        int length = s.length();
        int currentNumber = 0, lastNumber = 0, result = 0;
        char operation = '+';
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            char currentChar = s.charAt(i);
            if (Character.isDigit(currentChar)) {
                currentNumber = (currentNumber * 10) + (currentChar - '0');
            }
            if (!Character.isDigit(currentChar) && !Character.isWhitespace(currentChar) || i == length - 1) {
                if (operation == '+' || operation == '-') {
                    result += lastNumber;
                    lastNumber = (operation == '+') ? currentNumber : -currentNumber;
                } else if (operation == '*') {
                    lastNumber = lastNumber * currentNumber;
                } else if (operation == '/') {
                    lastNumber = lastNumber / currentNumber;
                }
                operation = currentChar;
                currentNumber = 0;
            }
        }
        result += lastNumber;
        return result;
    }
}
```
