# 371. [Sum of Two Integers][STI] (两整数之和)

[STI]: https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/

**Difficulty:** `easy`

**Tag:** `Bit Manipulation`

------

## Question

Calculate the sum of two integers `a` and `b`, but you are **not allowed** to use the operator `+` and `-`.

------

## Method

Divide the calculation process into two parts:

1. Use ***AND***`&` operation to calculate the digits need to carry.
2. Use ***XOR***`^` operation to calculate the digits don't need to carry.
3. When there are no digits need to carry, return result.

##### Own Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        int carry = a & b;
        int temp = a ^ b;
        if (carry != 0){
            carry <<= 1;
            temp = getSum(temp, carry);
        }
        return temp;}}
```
