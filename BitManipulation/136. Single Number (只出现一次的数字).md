## Question

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears *twice* except for one. Find that single one.

------

## Method 1 -- Bit Manipulation

 Here, we could use bit operator ***XOR***(异或) `⊕`.

- If we take ***XOR*** of zero and some bit, it will return that bit
  - a ⊕ 0 = a
- If we take ***XOR*** of two same bits, it will return 0
  - a ⊕ a = 0
- ***XOR*** operation satisfies commutative and associative laws 
  - a ⊕ b ⊕ a = (a ⊕ a) ⊕ b = 0 ⊕ b =b

Assume there are *2m+1* numbers in array, and *m* numbers appears twice, only one number appear once. Take *a1*, *a2*, *a3*, ... , *am* as *m* numbers appears twice, *am+1* is the number appears once. According to characteristic 3, ***XOR*** operation of all nodes could write as follows:

- (*a*1 ⊕ *a*1) ⊕ ( *a*2 ⊕ *a*2) ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ (*am* ⊕ *am*) ⊕ *am* + 1

And according to characteristic 1 and 2, the above formula could be simplified as follows:

- 0 ⊕ 0 ⊕⋯⊕ 0 ⊕ *am+ 1* = *am+1*

Thus, after ***XOR*** operation of all elements in array, the result is the number appears once.

```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int single = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            single ^= num;
        }
        return single;}}

##### Complexity

- *Time Complexity:* O(N)
- *Space Complexity:* O(1)

#### Method 2 -- Own Method

1. Resort this array. Then, the array will become `[x,x,y,y,z,a,a,...]`.
2. Use a `for` loop, check two numbers at a time and determine whether they are equal. If not, the answer is `nums[i]`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 1){return nums[0];}
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i += 2){
            if (nums[i] != nums[i+1]){
                return nums[i];
            }
        }
        return nums[nums.length - 1];}}
```
