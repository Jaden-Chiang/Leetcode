**Difficulty:** `easy`

**Tag:** `Bit Manipulation`

------

## Question

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of `1` bits it has (also known as the *<u>Hamming weight</u>*)

------

## Method

#### Method 1 -- Loop and Filp

The solution is straight-forward. We check each of the 32-bits of the number. If the bit is 1, we add one to number of 1-bits.

We can check the *i th* bit of a number using a *bit mask*. The difference between reference code and mine is it moves bit mask and I move the original number.

##### Reference Code

```java
public int hammingWeight(int n) {
    int bits = 0;
    int mask = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        if ((n & mask) != 0) {
            bits++;
        }
        mask <<= 1;
    }
    return bits;
}

##### Own Code

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i ++){
            if ((n & 1) == 1){
                res ++;
            }
            n >>>= 1;
        }
        return res;}}
```

##### Complexity

- *Time Complexity:* O(1)
- *Space Complexity:* O(1)

#### Method 2 -- Bit Manipulation Trick

We can make the previous algorithm simpler and a little faster. Instead of checking every bit of number, we repeatedly flip the least-significant 1-bit of the number to 0, and add 1 to the sum. As soon as the number becomes 0, we know that it does not have any more 1-bits, and we return the sum.

The key idea here is to realize that for any number *n*, doing a bit-wise ***AND*** of *n* and *n-1* flips the least-significant 1-bit in *n* to 0. Why? Consider the binary representations of *n* and *n-1*.

##### Reference Code

```java
public int hammingWeight(int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    while (n != 0) {
        sum++;
        n &= (n - 1);
    }
    return sum;
}
