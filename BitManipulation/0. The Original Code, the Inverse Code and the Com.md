## 1. Number of machines and truth values

Before learning the original code, the inverse code and the complement, we need to understand the concept of machine number and truth value first.

#### 1.1 Number of machines

A binary representation of a number in a computer, called the number of machines in this number. The number of machines is signed, with a number of digits at the top of the computer holding the symbol, positive 0, minus 1.

For example, in the decimal number `+3`, the computer word length is 8 bits, converted into binary is `00000011`. If it is `-3`, it is `10000011`.

So, `00000011` and `10000011` here are the number of machines.

#### 1.2 Truth Value

Because the first digit is the sign bit, the form value of the machine number is not equal to the true value. For example, the above signed number `10000011`, whose highest digit `1` represents a negative, whose true value is `-3` instead of the form value `131` (`10000011` is converted to decimal equals 131). Therefore, for the sake of distinction, the true numeric value of the number of machines with signed bits is called the truth of the number of machines.

For example: `0000 0001` of the truth value = `+000 0001` = `+1`, `1000 0001` of the truth value = `-000 0001` = `-1`.

## 2. Original code, inverse code, complement basic concept and calculation methods

Before we explore why the machine uses the complement, let's first understand the concept of the original code, the inverse code and the complement. For a number, the computer is stored in a certain encoding. The original code, the inverse code, the complement is the machine to store a specific number of encoding methods.

#### 2.1 Original code

The original code is the symbol bit plus the absolute value of the truth, that is, use the first digit to represent the symbol, the remaining bits represents value. For example, if it is 8-bit binary:

- *original* `+1` = `0000 0001`

- *original* `-1` = `1000 0001`

The first digit is the sign bit. Because the first bit is a sign bit, the range of 8-bit binary number is `[1111 1111, 0111 1111]`, in decimal is `[-127, 127]`.

#### 2.2 Inverse code

The way to represent the inverse code is: 

- The inverse code of a positive number is its own.
- The inverse code of a negative number is based on its original code, the symbol bit is unchanged, and the remaining bits are reversed.

For example: 

- `+1` = *original* `0000 0001` = *inverse* `0000 0001`
- `-1` = *original* `1000 0001` = *inverse* `1111 1110`

## 3 Why use the original code, the inverse code and the complement

Now we know that a computer can represent a number in three ways. For positive numbers, the results are the same for three encoding methods:

- `+1` = *original* `0000 0001` = *inverse* `0000 0001` = *complement* `0000 0001`

And for negative numbers:

- `-1` = *original* `1000 0001` = *inverse* `1111 1110` = *complement* `1111 1111`

The original code is visible, the inverse code and the complement are completely different. Since the original code is directly recognized by the human brain and used to calculate the expression, why there will be inverse code and complement it?

First of all, because the human brain can know that the first digit is the sign bit, we choose the addition and subtraction of the truth value's region according to the sign bit in the calculation. But for computers, the arithmetic is the basic operation. Computer identification "Symbol bit" will obviously make the computer's basic circuit design becomes very complex. So people came up with a way to take the symbol bit into operation, that is, `1-1 = 1+(-1) = 0`. Thus, the machine could only perform addition, the computer operation design is simpler.

So people began to explore the method of taking the sign bit to the operation and preserving only the addition. First look at the original code:

- `1-1` = `1+(-1)` = *original* `0000 0001` + *original* `1000 0001` = *original* `1000 0010` = `-2`

If you use the original code, let the sign bit also participate in the calculation, obviously for subtraction, the result is incorrect. This is why the computer doesn't use the original code to represent a number.

To solve the problem of subtraction in the original code, an inverse code appears:

- `1-1` = `1+(-1)` = *original* `0000 0001` + *original* `1000 0001` =  *inverse* `0000 0001` + *inverse* `1111 1110`  =*inverse* `1111 1111` = *original* `1000 0000` = `-0`

It is found that the truth value of the result is correct when subtraction is calculated by inverse code. And the only problem is actually  in the particular value 0. Although people understand that `+0` and `-0` are the same, there will be `0000 0000` and `1000 0000` two codes represent 0.

Therefore, the complement appears and solve this problem.

-  `1-1` = `1+(-1)` = *original* `0000 0001` + *original* `1000 0001` =  *complement* `0000 0001` + *complement* `1111 1111`  =*complement* `0000 0000` = *original* `0000 0000` = `0`

So 0 is represent by `0000 0000`, and previous problem doesn't exist. Besides, `-128` could be represent by `1000 0000` :

- `(-1)-(-127)` = *original* `1000 0001` + *original* `1111 1111` =  *complement* `1111 1111` + *complement* `1000 0001`  =*complement* `1000 0000` = *original* `1000 0000` = `-128`

Complement code `1000 000` is `-128`. But note that  because it actually uses the complement code of  `-0` to represents `-128`, so `-128` doesn't have the original code and the inverse code.

Using the complement, not only fixes the problem that 0 exists two codes, but also could represent a minimum number. This is why the 8-bit binary, which uses the original code or inverse code to denote a range of `[-127,127]`, uses complement code denotes  a range of `[-128,127]`.

Because the machine uses the complement, the 32-bit int type that is commonly used in programming could be expressed as a range of `[-2^31, 2^31-1]`. Using complement code representation could save a minimum value.

## 4. Original code, inverse code and complement code, learn more

The computer cleverly let the sign bit participates in the operation, and change subtraction into addition. What kind of mathematical principles are behind it?

Image a clock as a 1-bit 12-digit number. If the current time is 6, we could do the following  to set the time to 4:

1. Dial back 2 hours : `6-2 = 4`
2. Dial forward 10 hours: `(6+10) % 12 = 4`
3. Dial forward 10+12 hours: `(6+22) % 12 = 4`

The method 2 and 3 is <u>modulo operation</u>(取模操作).  So the operation dial back (subtraction) could be replaced by dial forward (addition). 

The focus now falls on how to replace a negative number with a positive number. And now we need to know a concept: ***congruence*** (同余).

#### The concept of congruence

If remainder of two integers `a` and `b` divided by `m` are equal, then it is called `a` and `b` congruence for `m`. Remember as `a` ≡ `b` (mod m). For example:

- 4 % 12 = 4
- 16 % 12 = 4
- 28 % 12 = 4

So 4, 16 and 28 are congruence.

#### Modulo operation of negative number

The modulo operation of a positive number is simple. But what about negative numbers? The mathematical definition of modulo operation is:

- x % y = x - y * [x / y ]min (`[]min` represents get low boundary)

So, we can calculate as following example:

- (-2) % 12 = (-2) - 12 * [(-2)/12]min = (-2) - 12 * (-1) = 10
- (-4) % 12 = (-4) - 12 * [(-4)/12]min = (-4) - 12 * (-1) = 8
- (-5) % 12 = 7

#### Starting proving

And now, we back to problem of block, we could find out:

- Dial back 2 hours = Dial forward 10 hours
- Dial back 4 hours = Dial forward 8 hours
- Dial back 5 hours = Dial forward 7 hours

Notice the rules here, actually:

- (-2) % 12  = 10 % 12 = 10, (-2) and 10 are congruence
- (-4) % 12 = 8 % 12 = 8, (-4) and 8 are congruence

If we want to use positive numbers replace negative numbers, we need two theorems of congruence:

1. a ≡ a (mod m)
2. If a ≡ b (mod m), c ≡ d (mod m), then:
   1. a ± c ≡ b ± d (mod m)
   2.  a * c ≡ b * d (mod m)

Because of `7 ≡ 7 (mod 12)`, `(-2) ≡ 10 (mod 12)`, we could get the conclusion: ` 7 -2 ≡ 7 + 10 (mod 12)`.

Now, we find a positive congruence for a negative number, and let's back to binary problem, think about `2 - 1 = 1`:

- `2-1` = `2+(-1)` = *original* `0000 0010` + *original* `1000 0001` =  *inverse* `0000 0010` + *inverse* `1111 1110`

Here, inverse code of `-1` is `1111 1110`, and if regard `1111 1110` as original code, the result is *original* `1111 1110` = `-126`. Ignore the sign digit, it is `126`. We could find the rules:

- (-1) % 127 = 126
- 126 % 127 = 126

That is, 

- (-1) ≡ 126 (mod 127)
- 2 - 1 ≡ 2 + 126 (mod 127)

The remainder of `2-1` and `2+126` are same! And this remainder is the calculate result we excepted `2-1 = 1`.

Therefore, a number's inverse code is this number's congruence for a module. This module is the maximum number we could represent. This is like a clock, after a turn, we can always find a correct value within the range that could be represented.

Since inverse code could change subtraction into addition, why does computer need to use complement code? Why add `1` to one's inverse code and still get the correct answer?

- `2-1` = `2+(-1)` = *original* `0000 0010` + *original* `1000 0001` =  *complement* `0000 0010` + *complement* `1111 1111` = *complement* `0111 1111`

If regard `0111 1111` as original code and remove sign digit, then, `0111 1111` = `127`. Actually, adding `1` to inverse code is same as increase value of modelu.

- (-1) % 128 = 127
- 127 % 128  = 127
- 2 - 1 ≡ 2 + 127 (mod 128)

And this is like as a "clock" with 128 graduations. So, the calculate result of complement code will have range `[-128, 128]`. However, due to special number `0`, the range is `[-128, 127]`.

## Bit Manipulation Tricks

##### 1. Fetch the bit at position `i` from left in the binary representation of a number

If `num & (1 << (postion - 1)) != 0`, bit is set.

##### 2. Toggle all the bits of a number: XOR the number with all one's

***XOR*** by bit 1 toggles the original bit: `num ^ 111..11`.

##### 3. Check if a given number is a power of 2

Number is power of `2` if `num & (num - 1) == 0`.

##### 4. Given an array of numbers. Array has only one element which is alone, all other elements appear in pair. Find that one element with missing pair in O(1) extra space.

***XOR*** of element with itself results value zero.

##### 5. Find the number of set bits in a binary representation of a number

Number of set bits in a number: `num = num & (num - 1)`, till `num != 0` and increment the counter at each step. Finally return the counter.
