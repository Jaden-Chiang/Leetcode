**Difficulty:** `easy`

**Tag:** `Tree`

## Question

Invert a binary tree.

------

## Method

#### Method 1 -- Recursive

This is a classic tree problem that is best-suited for a recursive approach.

The inverse of an empty tree is the empty tree. The inverse of a tree with root *T*, and subtree `left` and `right`, is a tree with root *T*, which right subtree is the inverse of  `left`, and whose left subtree is the inverse of `right`.

We could begin the inverse from the leaf node, and traverse the whole tree.

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        TreeNode left = invertTree(root.left);
        TreeNode right = invertTree(root.right);
        root.left = right;
        root.right = left;
        return root;
    }
}

##### Complexity

- *Time Complexity:* O(N)
- *Space Complexity:* O(h)

#### Method 2 -- Iterative

Alternatively, we can solve the problem iteratively, in a manner similar to *breadth-first search*.

The idea is that we need to swap the left and right child of all nodes in the tree. So we create a queue to store nodes whose left and right child have not been swapped yet. Initially, only the root is in the queue. As long as the queue is not empty, remove the next node from the queue, swap its children, and add the children to the queue. Null nodes are not added to the queue. Eventually, the queue will be empty and all the children swapped, and we return the original root.

##### Own Code

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null){return null;}
        
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.offer(root);
        while(! q.isEmpty()){//Remark_1
            TreeNode tn = q.poll();
            if (tn != null){
            changTree(tn);
            q.offer(tn.left);
            q.offer(tn.right); 
            }
        }
        return root;}
    
    public TreeNode changTree(TreeNode root){
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null){return root;}
        TreeNode temp = null;
        temp = root.left;
        root.left = root.right;
        root.right = temp;
        return root;}}
```

##### Reference Code

```java
public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
    if (root == null) return null;
    Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<TreeNode>();
    queue.add(root);
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        TreeNode current = queue.poll();
        TreeNode temp = current.left;
        current.left = current.right;
        current.right = temp;
        if (current.left != null) queue.add(current.left);
        if (current.right != null) queue.add(current.right);
    }
    return root;
}
```

*Remark_1: If we want to check one list is empty or not, we should use method **isEmpty()**. In this code, I use `q != null` at first, but `q` will never be null because I already instantiated it with `new LinkedList`, so there will result in an infinite loop.

*However, `Queue` implementations generally do not allow insertion of null elements, although some implementations, such as `LinkedList`, do not prohibit insertion of null.*
