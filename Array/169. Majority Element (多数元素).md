# 169. [Majority Element][ME] (多数元素)

[ME]: https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/majority-element/	"Majority Element"

**Difficulty:** `easy`

**Tag:** `Array` / `Divide and Conquer` / `Bit Manipulaiton`

------

### **Question**

Given an array size *n*, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears **more than** `[n]/2` times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

------

### **Method**

#### Method 1 -- Hash Table

We know the times of element appears most is more than `[n]/2`, so we can use a hash table to count the times of occurences of each element.

One of reference methods is traverse  hash table to search the biggest time, another is set a parameter means the biggest time. In this way, we could omit the final traverse to hash table.

My method is determine times after each loop, when find the element appears more than `[n]/2` times, finish the loop immediately.

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
    private Map<Integer, Integer> countNums(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> counts = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (!counts.containsKey(num)) {
                counts.put(num, 1);
            } else {
                counts.put(num, counts.get(num) + 1);
            }
        }
        return counts;
    }

    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> counts = countNums(nums);

        Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> majorityEntry = null;
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : counts.entrySet()) {
            if (majorityEntry == null || entry.getValue() > majorityEntry.getValue()) {
                majorityEntry = entry;
            }
        }

        return majorityEntry.getKey();
    }
}

##### Own Code

```java

    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer,Integer> times = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (times.containsKey(nums[i])){
                times.put(nums[i],times.get(nums[i])+1);
                if (times.get(nums[i])>(nums.length/2)){
                    return nums[i];
                }
            }else{
                times.put(nums[i],1);
                 if (times.get(nums[i])>(nums.length/2)){
                    return nums[i];
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

##### Complexity

#### Method 2 -- Sort

If all the elements in the array `nums` are sorted in a monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing order, then the element with subscript `[n/2]` must be the mode (众数).

The following graph explains why this algorithm is effective.

In the picture, the line below numbers means the subscript to be overwritten if the mode is the smallest value in the array. And the line above the numbers means the biggest value in the array. In other cases, the line will be in the middle of these two extreme cases. Therefore, whatever the array's length is odd or even, the subscript `[n/2]` is always the position of mode.

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        return nums[nums.length / 2];
    }
}

##### Complexity

- *Time Complexity:* O(NlogN)
- *Space Complexity:* O(logN)

> **Review On:** This method is too concise! But finding this law is not easy.

#### Method 3 -- Random

Because of more than `[n/2]` elements is mode, we could choose an element at random and check how many times it appears. If not, find next number.

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
    private int randRange(Random rand, int min, int max) {
        return rand.nextInt(max - min) + min;
    }

    private int countOccurences(int[] nums, int num) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == num) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        Random rand = new Random();

        int majorityCount = nums.length / 2;

        while (true) {
            int candidate = nums[randRange(rand, 0, nums.length)];
            if (countOccurences(nums, candidate) > majorityCount) {
                return candidate;}}}}

#### Method 4 -- Divide and Conquer

If number `a` is mode of array `nums`, we could divide the array into two parts, and `a` must be at least part of the mode.

We could use disproval (反证法) to prove it. Assume `a` is neither mode of left part `l` nor the mode of right part `r`. Then the times of `a` appears must less than `l/2 + r/2`. Due to `l/2 + r/2 <= (l+r)/2`, the `a` is not the mode of `nums`. There is a contradiction, so the conclusion is correct.

We use divide-and-conquer method to recursive solution. When the length of all subpeoblems is *1*,  the only number is the mode obviously. In the retrospective phase, when the length of interval more than *1*, we need to merge left and right subinterval. If they have same mode, this number is still as mode. Otherwise, we need to compare the times they appears in this interval and determine which is.

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
    private int countInRange(int[] nums, int num, int lo, int hi) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = lo; i <= hi; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == num) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    private int majorityElementRec(int[] nums, int lo, int hi) {
        // base case; the only element in an array of size 1 is the majority
        // element.
        if (lo == hi) {
            return nums[lo];
        }

        // recurse on left and right halves of this slice.
        int mid = (hi - lo) / 2 + lo;
        int left = majorityElementRec(nums, lo, mid);
        int right = majorityElementRec(nums, mid + 1, hi);

        // if the two halves agree on the majority element, return it.
        if (left == right) {
            return left;
        }

        // otherwise, count each element and return the "winner".
        int leftCount = countInRange(nums, left, lo, hi);
        int rightCount = countInRange(nums, right, lo, hi);

        return leftCount > rightCount ? left : right;
    }

    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        return majorityElementRec(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
    }

#### Method 5 -- Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

If we record the mode as *+1* and the other numbers as *-1*, and add them all together. The sum is more than 0 obviously, because mode occupies the majority.

The Boyer-Moore voting algorithm is similar as the divide-and-conquer, the steps as follows:

- We maintain a parameter `candidate` and `count` to store the possible mode and times it appears. The `candidate` could be a random value at the beginning, and the `count` is 0.
- We traverse all elements in the array `nums`. Before dtermining each element `x`, if `count` is 0, we give the value of `x` to `candidate`, adn then:
  - If `x` = `candidate`, the `count` increase 1;
  - if `x` isn't equal to `candidate`, the `count` decrease 1.
- After traverse, the `candidate` is mode of array.

For example, given a array as follows:

`[7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 1 | 5, 7, | 5, 5, 7, 7 | 7, 7, 7, 7]`

Traversing to the first element and the element after `|`, the `candidate` will change due to the value of `count` change to 0. The value of `candidate` change from *5* to *7* at last, so *7* is the mode.

In the tracersal, the values of `candidate` and `count` are as follows:

`numes:[7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 1 | 5, 7, | 5, 5, 7, 7 | 7, 7, 7, 7]`

`candidate: [7  7  7  7  7  7  5  5  5  5  5  5  7  7  7  7]`

`count: [1  2  1  2  1  0  1  0  1  2  1  0  1  2  3  4`]

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        Integer candidate = null;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (count == 0) {
                candidate = num;
            }
            count += (num == candidate) ? 1 : -1;
        }

        return candidate;
    }
}
