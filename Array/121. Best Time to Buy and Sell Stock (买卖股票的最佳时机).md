# 121. [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock][BTBSS] (买卖股票的最佳时机)

[BTBSS]: https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/	"Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock"

**Difficulty:**`easy`

**Tag:**`Array` / `Dynamic Programming`

------

### **Question**

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an alogorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

------

### **Method**

#### Method 1 -- Violent Enumeration

Violent enumeration wastes a lot of time.

##### Reference Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int prices[]) {
        int maxprofit = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < prices.length; j++) {
                int profit = prices[j] - prices[i];
                if (profit > maxprofit) {
                    maxprofit = profit;
                }
            }
        }
        return maxprofit;
    }
}

##### Complexity Analysis

- *Time Complexity*: O(N^2)

- *Space Complexity*: O(1)

#### Method 2 -- Traverse Once

My method is same as ***53. Maximum Subarray***, set four parameters:

`pre_price` - The minimum price among prices have been teaversed.

`diff` - The difference betweent current price and `pre_price`.

`max` - Store the maximum difference.

The traverse is beginning at the secone number in the array, and if the `diff` is a nagetive number, then set the current price as `pre_price`. If the `diff` is a positve number, keep `diff` unchanged. In this case, the progeam execution process is as follows:

##### Reference Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int prices[]) {
        int minprice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;//Remark_1
        int maxprofit = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] < minprice) {
                minprice = prices[i];
            } else if (prices[i] - minprice > maxprofit) {
                maxprofit = prices[i] - minprice;
            }
        }
        return maxprofit;
    }
}

##### Own Code

```java
public class BuySell {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        while(prices.length != 0) {
            int pre_price = prices[0];
            int max = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
                int diff = prices[i] - pre_price;
                if (diff < 0) {
                    pre_price = prices[i];
                }
                max = Math.max(diff, max);
            }
            return max;
        }
        return 0;
    }
```

*Remark_1: `Integer.MAX_VALUE` is a constant in the **Integer class** of **java.lang.package** that specifies that stores the maximum possible value for any integer variable in Java. The actual value of this is: 2^31 - 1 = 2147486347.*

*And use `Integer.MAX_VALUE` here is to avoid empty array. My method needs to determine whether the array is empty.*

##### Complexity

- *Time Complexity:* O(n)
- *Space Complexity:* O(1)
