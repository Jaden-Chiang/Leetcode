# 86. [Partition List][PL] (分割链表)

**Difficulty:** `medium`

**Tag:** `Linked List` / `Two Poniters`

## Question

Given the `head` of a linked list and a value `x`, partition it such that all nodes **less than** `x` come before nodes **greater than or equal** to `x`. You should **preserve** the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

------

## Solution

The problem wants us to reform the linked list structure, such that the elements lesser that a certain value `x`, come before the elements greater or equal to `x`. This essentially means in this reformed list, there would be a point in the linked list `before` which all the elements would be smaller than `x` and `after` which all the elements would be greater or equal to `x`. Let's call this point as the `JOINT`.

We can take two pointers `before` and `after` to keep track of the two linked list as described above. These two pointers could be used two create two separate lists and then these lists could be combined to form the desired reformed list.

The algorithm is as following:

1. Initialize two pointers `before` and `after`. In the implementation we have initialized these two with a dummy `ListNode`. This helps to reduce the number of conditional checks we would need otherwise.

2. Iterate the original linked list, using the `head` pointer.
3. If the node's value pointed by `head` is *lesser* than `x`, the node should be part of the `before` list. So we move it to `before` list.

4. Else, the node should be part of `after` list. So we move it to `after` list.

5. Once we done with all the nodes in the original linked list, we would have two list `before` and `after`. The original list nodes are either part of `before` list or `after` list, depending on its value.

6. Now, these two lists `before` and `after` can be combined to form the reformed list.

We did a dummy node initialization at the start to make implementation easier, you don't want that to be part of the returned list, hence just move ahead on node in both the lists while combining the two lists. Since both before and after have an extra node at the front.

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode partition(ListNode head, int x) {

        // before and after are the two pointers used to create the two list
        // before_head and after_head are used to save the heads of the two lists.
        // All of these are initialized with the dummy nodes created.
        ListNode before_head = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode before = before_head;
        ListNode after_head = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode after = after_head;

        while (head != null) {

            // If the original list node is lesser than the given x,
            // assign it to the before list.
            if (head.val < x) {
                before.next = head;
                before = before.next;
            } else {
                // If the original list node is greater or equal to the given x,
                // assign it to the after list.
                after.next = head;
                after = after.next;
            }

            // move ahead in the original list
            head = head.next;
        }

        // Last node of "after" list would also be ending node of the reformed list
        after.next = null;

        // Once all the nodes are correctly assigned to the two lists,
        // combine them to form a single list which would be returned.
        before.next = after_head.next;

        return before_head.next;
    }
}
```
