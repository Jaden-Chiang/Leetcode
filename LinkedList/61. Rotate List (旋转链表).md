# 61. [Rotate List][RL] (旋转链表)

[RL]: https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/rotate-list/

**Difficulty:** `medium`

**Tag:** `Linked List` / `Two Poniters`

------

## Question

Given the `head` of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

------

## Solution

All nodes in linked list are already connected, rotating once means:

- First close the linked list into a ring.
- Find the corresponding position to break the ring, and determine the new list head and end.

Now, the problems are:

- Where is the new head node?

At the position `n-k`, and `n` represents the number of nodes in linked list. The new tail node of new linked list is at position `n-k-1`.

- In the previous problem, we assume `k<n`. But how to solve when `k>=n`?

`k` could be represented as `k = (k/n)*n + k%n`. The previous apart doesn't affect finally result, we only need to consider about the part `k%n`, this value is must smaller than `n`.

The algorithm could be realized as follows:

- Find the tail node of original linked list and connect it with head node: `oldTail.next=head`. Close the linked list into a ring and count the length of linked list.
- Find the new tail node, that is the `(n - k%n - 1)` node. The new head node is `(n - k&n)` node.
- Cut the ring: `newTail.next = NULL`, and return the new head node.

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
  public ListNode rotateRight(ListNode head, int k) {
    // base cases
    if (head == null) return null;
    if (head.next == null) return head;

    // close the linked list into the ring
    ListNode old_tail = head;
    int n;
    for(n = 1; old_tail.next != null; n++)
      old_tail = old_tail.next;
    old_tail.next = head;

    // find new tail : (n - k % n - 1)th node
    // and new head : (n - k % n)th node
    ListNode new_tail = head;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - k % n - 1; i++)
      new_tail = new_tail.next;
    ListNode new_head = new_tail.next;

    // break the ring
    new_tail.next = null;

    return new_head;
  }
}

**Complexity:** `Time: O(N)` / `Space: O(1)`

##### Own Code

My approach is make two pointers which are separated by `k` nodes, but here, the `k` may be bigger than `n`, so I need to exclude special situation.

And then, I move two pointers until the pointer at back arrives tail, then the pointer in front is the new tail, and the node behind it is the new head node.

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode rotateRight(ListNode head, int k) {
        if (k == 0) return head;
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        ListNode sentinel = head;
        ListNode p1 = head;
        ListNode p2 = head.next;
        for (int i = 1; i < k; i ++){
            if (p2.next != null){
                p2 = p2.next;
            }else {
                p2 = head;
            }
        }
        while (p2.next != null){
            p1 = p1.next;
            p2 = p2.next;
        }
        if (p1.next != null){
            sentinel = p1.next;
        }else{
            sentinel = head;
        }
        p2.next = head;
        p1.next = null;
        return sentinel;
    }
}
```
