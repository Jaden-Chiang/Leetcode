## Question

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

------

## Solution

#### Approach 1 -- Recursion

We could realize swapping nodes in pairs by using recursion. The termination condition is there are non nodes in the linked list or only one node. At this time, it could not be swapped.

If there are more than two nodes in the linekd list, the head node of original linked list will be the second node in the new linekd list after swapping. And the second node will be move to head. The remaining nodes in the linked list could swap recursively. After swapping, we need to update the pointer relationship between nodes.

Use `head` represents head node in the original linked list (it's also the second node in new linked list), use `newHead` represents head node in new linked list (it's also the second node in original linked list). The remaining nodes' head node is `newHead.next`. Use `head.next = swapPairs(newHead.next)` represents swap other nodes in pairs. The new head node is the next node of `head`, and then we make `newHead.next = head` to complete swapping. At last, we return the head node `newHead` of new linked list.

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return head;
        }
        ListNode newHead = head.next;
        head.next = swapPairs(newHead.next);
        newHead.next = head;
        return newHead;
    }
}

##### Own Code

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {

        if (head == null) return null;
        if (head.next == null) return head;
        if (head.next.next == null) {
            ListNode curr = head.next;
            head.next = null;
            curr.next = head;
            return curr;
        }else {
            ListNode ans = deterChange(head);
            return ans;}}
        
        public ListNode deterChange(ListNode head){
            if (head == null) return null;
            ListNode p = head;
            if (head.next != null) {
                head = head.next;
            }else {
                return head;
            }
            ListNode q = head;
            if (head.next != null) {
                head = head.next;
            }else {
                p.next = null;
                q.next = p;
                return q;
            }
            q.next = p;
            p.next = deterChange(head);
            return q;
        }
}
```

*Record_1: In the recursion, the final return is the variable at the first recursion, so after entering the recursion, the initialization of thevariable would not effect the final result. For expamle, in the reference code, `newHead` will always be initialized. In the own code, the duplication of code (initialized `ans`) is due to unawareness of this problem.*

#### Approach 2 -- Iteration

We also could use iteration to solve this problem.

Create a dummy node `dummyHead`, make `dummyHead.next = head`. Create `temp` represents the current node, at beginning, `temp = dummyHead`, and we need to swap two nodes behind `temp`.

If there are no node or only one node behind `temp`, that is no node need to swap, then the swapping ends. Otherwise, get two nodes `node1` and `node2` behind `temp`, swapping two nodes by upadating the relationships between pointers. In particular, the  relationship of nodes before swapping is: `temp->node1->node2`, and after swapping, it is: `temp->node2->node1`, so we need to do operation as following:

```
temp.next = node2;
node1.next = node2.next;
node2.next = node1;
```

Then, we make `temp = node1`, and swapping remaining nodes until all nodes are swapped. Finally, return new head `dummyHead.next` of linked list.

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
        ListNode dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
        dummyHead.next = head;
        ListNode temp = dummyHead;
        while (temp.next != null && temp.next.next != null) {
            ListNode node1 = temp.next;
            ListNode node2 = temp.next.next;
            temp.next = node2;
            node1.next = node2.next;
            node2.next = node1;
            temp = node1;
        }
        return dummyHead.next;}}
