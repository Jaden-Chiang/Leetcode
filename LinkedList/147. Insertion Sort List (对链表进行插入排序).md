## Question

Sort a linked list using insertion sort.

------

## Solution

Let us first review the idea of insertion sort algorithm, which can be broke down into the following steps:

- First of all, we create an empty list which would be used to hold the results of sorting.
- We then iterate through each element in the *input* list. For each element, we need to find a proper position in the resulting list to insert the element, so that the order of the resulting list is maintained.
- As one can see, once the iteration in the above step terminates, we will obtain the resulting list where the elements are *ordered*.

Now, let us walk through a simple example, by applying the above intuition.

Given the input list `input=[4,3,5]`, we have initially an empty resulting list `result=[]`.

- We then iterate over the input list. For the first element `4`, we need to find a proper position in the resulting list to place it. Since the resulting list is still empty, we then simply *append* it to the resulting list, i.e. `result=[4]`.

- Now for the second element (i.e. `3`) in the input list, similarly we need to insert it properly into the resulting list. As one can see, we need to insert it right before the element `4`. As a result, the resulting list becomes `[3,4]`.

![](https://leetcode.com/problems/insertion-sort-list/Figures/147/147_linked_list_step_2.png)

- Finally, for the last element (i.e. `5`) in the input list, as it turns out, the proper position to place it is, the *tail* of the resulting list. With this last iteration, we obtain a *sorted* list as `result=[3,4,5]`.

**Algorithm:**

To translate the above intuition into the implementation, we applied two tricks.

> The first is that we will create a **dummy** node which serves as a pointer pointing to the resulting list.

More precisely, this node facilitates us to always get a *hold* on the resulting list, especially when we need to insert a new element to the head of the resulting list. One will see later in more details how it can greatly simplify the logic.

In a *singly-linked list*, each node has only pointer that points to the next node. If we would like to insert a new node (say `B`) before certain node (say `A`), we need to know the node (say `C`) that is currently before the node `A`, i.e. `C->A`. With the reference in the node `C`, we could now insert the new code, i.e. `C->B->A`.

Given the above insight, in order to insert a new element into a singly-linked list, we apply another trick.

> The idea is that we use a **pair of pointers** (names prev->next) which serve as place-holders to guard the position where in-between we could insert a new element (i.e. prev->new_node->next).

With the same example before, i.e. `input=[4,3,5]`, we illustrate what the above helper pointers look like at the moment of insertion, in the following graph:

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode insertionSortList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode();
        ListNode curr = head;

        while (curr != null) {
            // At each iteration, we insert an element into the resulting list.
            ListNode prev = dummy;

            // find the position to insert the current node
            while (prev.next != null && prev.next.val < curr.val) {
                prev = prev.next;
            }

            ListNode next = curr.next;
            // insert the current node to the new list
            curr.next = prev.next;
            prev.next = curr;

            // moving on to the next iteration
            curr = next;
        }

        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

**Complexity:** `Time: O(N^2)` / `Space: O(1)`

##### Own code

My method is using two pointers `start` and `end` to store the sort sublist, and according the value of each element to certain the position they should to insert.

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode insertionSortList(ListNode head) {
        //排除两个特殊情况
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        
        //设置头部哑节点以便访问
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        
        //对前两个节点进行排序，建立排序区间
        ListNode p1 = head;
        ListNode p2 = head.next;
        ListNode start = null, end = null;
        if (head.val > head.next.val) {
            p1.next = p2.next;
            dummy.next = p2;
            p2.next = p1;
            start = p2;
            end = p1;
        }else {
            start = p1;
            end = p2;
        }
        ListNode ins = end.next;
        
        //依次插入其余节点
        while (ins != null){
            if (ins.val <= start.val){
                end.next = ins.next;
                ins.next = start;
                start = ins;
                dummy.next = start;
                ins = end.next;
            }else if (ins.val >= end.val){
                end = ins;
                ins = ins.next;
            }else {
                //进入插入数值循环
                    end.next = ins.next;
                    ListNode q1 = start;
                    ListNode q2 = start.next;
                while (true){
                    if (ins.val > q1.val && ins.val <= q2.val){
                        q1.next = ins;
                        ins.next = q2;
                        break;
                    }else{
                        q2 = q2.next;
                        q1 = q1.next;
                    }
                }
                ins = end.next;
            }
        }
        
        //返回结果
        return dummy.next;}}
    }
}
```
