**Difficulty:** `easy`

**Tag:** `Linked List`

## Question

Reverse a singly linked list.

------

## Method

#### Method 1 -- Interation

Assume we have a linked list: `1 -> 2 ->3 -> \`, now we want to change it to `\ <- 1 <- 2 <- 3`. When we traveser linked list, we need to change pointer `next` of current node points to previous node. However, the node doesn't have reference to previous node. So we need to store prevoius node. Before we change reference, we also need another pointer points to next node. And don't forget return the new head node at last.

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            ListNode nextTemp = curr.next;//Remark_1
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = nextTemp;
        }
        return prev;
    }
}

*Remark_1:  This line of create new `ListNode` is in the while loop. It could solve NullPointException. And we don't consider move it in each step.*

##### Complexity

- *Time Complexity:* O(N)
- *Space Complexity:* O(1)

#### Method 2 -- Recursion

We could think a question: Assuming that the second part of linked list has been reversed, how do we reverse the previous part?

Assume linked list is as follows:

`n1 -> ... -> nk-1 -> nk -> nk+1 -> ... -> nm -> \`

If the part from `nk+1` to `nm` has been reversed, that is:

`n1 -> ... -> nk-1 -> nk -> nk+1 <- ... <- nm`

We want to the next code of `nk+1` is `nk`. That is, `nk.next.next = nk`.

Meanwhile, we should be careful that the next code of `n1` must point to `\`, if ignore this, there may be cycles in linked list.

In this case, it's process of recursion is:

```java
reverseList: head=1
    reverseList: head=2
	    reverseList: head=3
		    reverseList:head=4
			    reverseList:head=5 
					//终止返回
				cur = 5
				4.next.next->4，即5->4
			cur=5
			3.next.next->3，即4->3
		cur = 5
		2.next.next->2，即3->2
	cur = 5
	1.next.next->1，即2->1
	
	//最后返回cur
```

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {//Knowlege
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return head;
        }
        ListNode p = reverseList(head.next);
        head.next.next = head;
        head.next = null;
        return p;
    }
}

##### Complexity

- *Time Complexity:* O(N)
- *Space Complexity:* O(N)

### Knowledge

***Recursion*** could use this template:

```java
public ListNode reverseList(参数0) {
    if (终止条件)
        return;

    逻辑处理（可能有，也可能没有，具体问题具体分析）

    //递归调用
    ListNode reverse = reverseList(参数1);

    逻辑处理（可能有，也可能没有，具体问题具体分析）
