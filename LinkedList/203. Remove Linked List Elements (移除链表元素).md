## Question

Remove all elements from a linked list of integers that have value ***val***.

------

## Method

When the element which will be deleted in the middle of list, it is easy to solve:

- Select the previous node `prev` to the node be deleted.
- Set node `next` of `prev` to the node `next` of node be deleted.

But if this node is the head node of list, the problem will become complex. And we coule solve it by create a `sentinel node`. `Sentinel node` is widely used in ***trees*** and ***linked list***, such as pseudo-heads, pseudo-tails, tags, etc. They are purely functional and usually do not store any data. Their main purpose is to standardize the linked list, such as making the linked list never empty or never headless, simplified insertion and deletion. In this case, `sentinel node` is used as pseudo-head.

- Initialize `sentinel node` as *ListNode(0)* and set `sentinel.next = head`.
- Initialize two pointers `curr` and `prev` points to current node and previous node.
- If `curr != nullptr`:
  - Compare current node and the node be deleted, if they are equal, then `prev.next = curr.next`.
  - Otherwise, `prev = curr`.
  - Traverse next node.
- Return `sentinel.next`.

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
  public ListNode removeElements(ListNode head, int val) {
    ListNode sentinel = new ListNode(0);
    sentinel.next = head;

    ListNode prev = sentinel, curr = head;
    while (curr != null) {
      if (curr.val == val) prev.next = curr.next;
      else prev = curr;
      curr = curr.next;
    }
    return sentinel.next;
  }
}

        ListNode sentinel = new ListNode(-1);
        sentinel.next = head;
        ListNode prev = sentinel;
        ListNode curr = head;
        while(curr != null){
            if (curr.val != val){
                prev = curr;
                curr = curr.next;
            }else{
                curr = curr.next;
                prev.next = curr;
            }

        }
        return sentinel.next;
    }
