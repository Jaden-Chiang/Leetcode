# 160. [Intersection of Two Linked Lists][ITLL] (相交链表)

[ITLL]: https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/	"Intersection of Two Linked Lists"

**Difficulty:** `easy`

**Tag:** `Linked List`

------

### **Question**

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

------

### **Method**

#### Method 1 -- Violent Solution

For every node *ai* in linked list `A`, traverse linked list `B` and check whether there is an element same as *ai* in linked list `B`.

##### Complexity

- *Time Complexity:* O(MN)
- *Space Complexity:* O(1)

#### Method 2 -- Hash Table

Traverse linked list `A`, and store address/quote of each node in *hash table*. Then, check whether there is a node *bi* in linked list `B`. If it is, the *bi* is the intersection.

##### Complexity

- *Time Complexity:* O(M+N)
- *Space Complexity:* O(1)

#### Method 3 -- Delete Multiple Elements

Assume linked list `A` is longer than linked list `B`. We could create two pointers point to node of `A` and `B` respectively, and then let `A` go a few steps earlier until length of `A` and `B` are same. Then we could check whether their nodes are same, if it is, return this node. Otherwise, move to next node and repeat this process.

##### Own Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
              int along = 0, blong = 0;
        ListNode a = headA;
        ListNode b = headB;
        while (a != null) {
            along++;
            a = a.next;
        }
        while (b != null) {
            blong++;
            b = b.next;
        }
        if (along - blong > 0) {
            int diff = along - blong;
            while (diff != 0) {
                headA = headA.next;
                diff--;
            }
        } else {
            int diff = blong - along;
            while (diff != 0) {
                headB = headB.next;
                diff--;
            }
        }
         while(headA!=headB){
            headA = headA.next;
            headB = headB.next;
        }
        return headA;}}
```

#### Method 4 -- Two Pointers

 We could create two pointers `pA` and `pB` point to head node of linked list `A `and `B` respectively. And then:

- Traverse two lists.
- If `pA` arrive the tail node of list `A`, then `pA` = `headB`, continue traverse.
- If `pB` arrive the tail node of list `B`, then `pB` = `headA`, continue traverse.
- When pointer of longer linked list points to head node of shorter list, their length difference is disappear.
- Thus, only need to traverse shorter list twice, then we could find answer.

        pA = pA == null ? headB : pA.next;
        pB = pB == null ? headA : pB.next;
    }
    return pA;
