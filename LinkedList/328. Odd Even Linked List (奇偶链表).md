# 328. [Odd Even Linked List][OELL] (奇偶链表)

[OELL]: https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/

**Difficulty:** `medium`

**Tag:** `Linked List`

------

## Question

Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.

You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(N) time complexity,

------

## Solution

Put the odd nodes in a linked list and the even nodes in another. Then link the evenList to the tail of the oddList.

**Algorithm:**

The solution is very intuitive. But it is not trivial to write a concise and bug-free code.

A well-formed `LinkedList` need two pointers head and tail to support operations at both ends. The variables `head` and `odd` are the head pointer and tail pointer of one `LinekdList` we call oddList; the variables `evenHead` and `even` are the head pointer and tail pointer of another `LinkedList` we call evenList. The algorithm traverses the original LinkedList and put the odd nodes into the oddList and the even nodes into the evenList. To traverse a LinkedList we need at least one pointer as an iterator for the current node. But here the pointers `odd` and `even` not only serve as the tail pointers but also act as the iterators of the original list.

**The best way of solving any linked list problem is to visualize it either in your mind or on a piece of paper.** An illustration of our algorithm is following:

##### Reference Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode oddEvenList(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        ListNode odd = head, even = head.next, evenHead = even;
        while (even != null && even.next != null) {
            odd.next = even.next;
            odd = odd.next;
            even.next = odd.next;
            even = even.next;
        }
        odd.next = evenHead;
        return head;
    }
}
```

**Complexity:** `Time: O(N)` / `Space: O(1)`

##### Own Code

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode oddEvenList(ListNode head) {
        //排除三种特殊情况
        if (head == null || head.next == null || head.next.next == null) return head;
        
        //设置指针向后移动次数，初始时为1
        int times = 1;
        //设置指针
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode start = head;
        ListNode p1 = head, p2 = head.next;
        ListNode evenTail = p2;
        ListNode end = start.next;
        while(end != null){
            for (int i = 1; i <= times; i ++){
                end = end.next;
                if (end == null) return dummy.next;
            }
            evenTail.next = end.next;
            start.next = end;
            end.next = p2;
            start = start.next; end = end.next; evenTail = evenTail.next;
            times ++;
        }
        
        //返回结果
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```
