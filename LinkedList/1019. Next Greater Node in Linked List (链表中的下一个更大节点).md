# 1019. [Next Greater Node in Linked List][NGNLL] (链表中的下一个更大节点)

[NGNLL]: https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/next-greater-node-in-linked-list/

**Difficulty:** `medium`

**Tag:** `Linked List` / `Stack`

------

## Question

We are given a linked list with `head` as the first node. Let's number the nodes in the list: `node_1, node_2, node_3, ...` etc.

Each node may have a next larger **value**: for  `node_i`, `next_larger(node_i)` is the `node_j.val` such that `j > i`, `node_j.val > node_i.val`, and `j` is the smallest possible choice. If such a `j` does not exist, the next larger value is `0`.

Return an array of integers `answer`, where `answer[i] = next_larger(node_{i+1})`.

------

## Solution

We could use violent solution. First, we create a list to store the value of each node. And then create an array whose length is equal to size of list. Finally, traverse this list, and change the value of each node and record in array.

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
   public int[] nextLargerNodes(ListNode head) {
    List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
    while (head != null) {
        list.add(head.val);
        head = head.next;
    }
    int[] res = new int[list.size()];
    for (int i = 0; i < list.size() - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < list.size(); j++) {
            if(list.get(j)>list.get(i)){
                res[i]=list.get(j);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return res;
	}
}
```

##### Own Code

```java
class Solution {
   public int[] nextLargerNodes(ListNode head) {
    List<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();//Knowledge
    while (head != null) {
        list.add(head.val);
        head = head.next;
    }
    int[] res = new int[list.size()];
    for (int i = 0; i < list.size() - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < list.size(); j++) {
            if(list.get(j)>list.get(i)){
                res[i]=list.get(j);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return res;
	}
}
```

### Knowledge

The reference code could be accepted though it has a high time complexity. However, my own code wouldn't be accepted with a wrong "*Time Limit Exceeded*". Our code is same with each other except one place: reference code use **ArrayList**, and I use **LinkedList**. This detail will make a major difference.

**ArrayList** and **LinkedList** both implements **List** interface and maintains insertion order. Both are non synchronized classes.

However, there are many differences between **ArrayList** and **LinkedList** classes that are given below.

| ArrayList                                                    | LinkedList                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1). ArrayList internally uses a **dynamic array** to store the elements. | LinkedList internally uses a **doubly linked list** to store the elements. |
| 2). Manipulation with ArrayList is **slow** because it internally uses an array. If any elements is removed from the array, all the bits are shifted in memory. | Manipulation with LinkedList is **faster** than ArrayList because it uses a doubly linked list, so no bit shifting is required in memory. |
| 3). An ArrayList class can **act as a list** only because it implements List only. | LinkedList class can **act as a list and queue** both because it implements List and Deque interfaces. |
| 4). ArrayList is **better for storing and accessing** data.  | LinkedList is **better for manipulating** data.              |

In this problem, the list we create only need to act as a list and it need to be easier to storing and accessing data, so we should choose **ArrayList**.
