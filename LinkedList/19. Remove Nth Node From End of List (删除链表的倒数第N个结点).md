**Difficulty:** `medium`

**Tag:** `Linked List` / `Two Poniters`

## Question

Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `nth` node from the end of the list and return its head.

------

## Solution

#### Approach 1 -- Calculate Length of Linked List

We notice that the problem could be simply reduced to another one: Remove the *(L-n+1)*th node from the beginning in the list, where *L* is the list length. This problem is easy to solve once we found list length *L*.

First we will add an auxiliary "dummy" node, which points to the list head. The "dummy" node is used to simplify some <u>corner cases</u>(极端案例) such as a list with only one node, or removing the head of the list. On the first pass, we find the list length *L*. Then we set a pointer to the dummy node and start to move it through the list till is comes to the *(L-n)*th node. We relink `next` pointer of the (L-n)th node to the (L-n-2)th node and we are done.

##### Reference Code

```java
public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
    ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    int length  = 0;
    ListNode first = head;
    while (first != null) {
        length++;
        first = first.next;
    }
    length -= n;
    first = dummy;
    while (length > 0) {
        length--;
        first = first.next;
    }
    first.next = first.next.next;
    return dummy.next;
}
```

**Complexity:** `Time: O(L)` / `Space: O(1)`

#### Approach 2 -- One Pass Algorithm

The above algorithm could be optimized to one pass. Instead of one pointer, we could use two pointers. The first pointer advances the list by `n+1` steps from the beginning, while the second pointer starts from the beginning of the list. Now, both pointers are exactly separated by `n` nodes apart. We maintain this constant gap by advancing both pointers together until the first pointer arrives past the last node. The second pointer will be pointing at the *n*th node counting from the last. We relink the next pointer of the node referenced by the second pointer to point to the node's next next node.

##### Reference Code

```java
public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
    ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    ListNode first = dummy;
    ListNode second = dummy;
    // Advances first pointer so that the gap between first and second is n nodes apart
    for (int i = 1; i <= n + 1; i++) {
        first = first.next;
    }
    // Move first to the end, maintaining the gap
    while (first != null) {
        first = first.next;
        second = second.next;
    }
    second.next = second.next.next;
    return dummy.next;
}
```

**Complexity:** `Time: O(L)` / `Space: O(L)`

##### Own Code

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        if (head.next == null) return null;
        List<ListNode> nodes = new LinkedList<ListNode>();//Record_1
        int i = 1;
        nodes.add(head);
        while (head != null){
            nodes.add(head.next);
            nodes.get(i - 1).next = head.next;
            head = head.next;
            i ++;
        }
        int size = nodes.size();
        if (n == size - 1){
            return nodes.get(1);
        }
        nodes.get(size - n - 2).next = nodes.get(size - n );
        return nodes.get(0);
    }
}
```

*Record_1: I use a list to store every nodes, it will waste more space.*

#### Approach 3 -- Stack

We also could put each elements into the stack while traversing linked list. According to the rule of FIFO, the *n*th node which be poped is the element need to be deleted. And this time, the top element in the stack is the previous node of the element need to be deleted.

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
        Deque<ListNode> stack = new LinkedList<ListNode>();
        ListNode cur = dummy;
        while (cur != null) {
            stack.push(cur);
            cur = cur.next;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            stack.pop();
        }
        ListNode prev = stack.peek();
        prev.next = prev.next.next;
        ListNode ans = dummy.next;
        return ans;
    }
}
