**Difficulty:** `easy`

**Tag:** `Greedy`

## Question

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookies.

Each child `i` has a greed factor `g[i]`, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie `j` has a size `s[j]`. If `s[j]>=g[i]`, we can assign the cookie `j` to the child `i`, and the child `i` will be content. Your goal is to maximum the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

## Method

#### Method -- Sort and Greedy

To content children as much as possible, we should contend each children in order of their greed factor from the perspective of greed. And for each child, the smallest size biscuit that can satisfy the child's appetite should be selected. The proof is as follows:

Assume there are `m` children, their greed factors are from `g1` to `gm`. And there are `n` cookies with sizes from `s1` to `sn`. Satisfy `gi<=gi+1` and `sj<=sj+1` (1<=i<=m,i<=j<=n).

Assume that after assigning cookies to first `i-1` children, the smallest cookie which could content `i` child is `j`, that is `sj` is the smallest in the cookies left which satisfy `gi<=sj`. The optimal solution is to assign the `j` cookie to `i` child. If not, consider the following two situations:

- Assume that `i<m` and `gi+1<=sj`, if assign `j` cookie to `i+1` child and still have cookies left, then could assign `j+1` cookie to `i` child, the result couldn't make more children to be content.

- Assume that `j<n`, if assign `j+1` cookie to `i` child, we could assign `j` to `i+1` child when `gi+1<=sj`, the result couldn't make more children to be content. If `gi+1>sj`, the `j` cookie couldn't assign to any children, so the remaining usable coolie is missing one piece. The result is even worse.

According to above analysis, we could use greedy to satisfy children as much as possible.

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);
        int numOfChildren = g.length, numOfCookies = s.length;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < numOfChildren && j < numOfCookies; i++, j++) {
            while (j < numOfCookies && g[i] > s[j]) {
                j++;
            }
            if (j < numOfCookies) {
                count++;}}
        return count;}}
```

##### Own Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);
        int result = 0;
        int p1 = 0;
        int p2 = 0;
        
        while (p1 < g.length && p2 < s.length){
            if (s[p2] >= g[p1]){
                result ++;
                p1 ++;
                p2 ++;
            }else{
                p2 ++;}}
        return result;}}
```
