# 232. [Implement Queue using Stacks][IQS] (用栈实现队列)

[IQS]: https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/

**Difficulty:** `easy`

**Tag:** `Stack` / `Design`

------

## Question

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

------

## Method

To Satisfy **FIFO** property of a queue we need to keep two stacks. They serve to reverse arrival order of the elements and one of them store the queue elements in their final order.

#### Own Method

```java
class MyQueue {
    Stack<Integer> mainStack;
    Stack<Integer> auxiStack;

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MyQueue() {
        mainStack = new Stack<>();
        auxiStack = new Stack<>();
    }
    
    /** Push element x to the back of queue. */
    public void push(int x) {
        mainStack.push(x);
    }
    
    /** Removes the element from in front of queue and returns that element. */
    public int pop() {
        while (! mainStack.isEmpty()){
            int temp = mainStack.pop();
            auxiStack.push(temp);
        }
        int result = auxiStack.pop();
        while (! auxiStack.isEmpty()){
            int temp = auxiStack.pop();
            mainStack.push(temp);
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    /** Get the front element. */
    public int peek() {
        while (! mainStack.isEmpty()){
            int temp = mainStack.pop();
            auxiStack.push(temp);
        }
        int result = auxiStack.peek();
        while (! auxiStack.isEmpty()){
            int temp = auxiStack.pop();
            mainStack.push(temp);
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    /** Returns whether the queue is empty. */
    public boolean empty() {
        return mainStack.isEmpty();
    }
}
```



#### Method 1

###### 1. Push

A queue is FIFO but a stack is LIFO. This means the newest element must be pushed to the bottom of the stack. To do so we first transfer all `s1` elements to auxiliary stack `s2`. Then the newly arrived element is pushed on the top of `s2` and all its elements are popped and pushed to `s1`.

```java
private int front;

public void push(int x) {
    if (s1.empty())
        front = x;
    while (!s1.isEmpty())
        s2.push(s1.pop());
    s2.push(x);
    while (!s2.isEmpty())
        s1.push(s2.pop());
}

**Complexity:** *Time:* O(N), *Space:* O(N)

###### 2. Pop

The algorithm pops an element from the stack `s1`, because `s1` stores always on its top the first inserted element in the queue. The front element of the queue is kept as `front`.

![](https://leetcode.com/media/original_images/232_queue_using_stacksBPop.png)

```java
// Removes the element from the front of queue.
public void pop() {
    s1.pop();
    if (!s1.empty())
        front = s1.peek();
}
来源：力扣（LeetCode）
```

**Complexity:** *Time:* O(1), *Space:* O(1)

###### 3. Empty

Stack `s1` contains all stack elements, so the algorithm checks `s1` size to return if the queue is empty.

```java
// Return whether the queue is empty.
public boolean empty() {
    return s1.isEmpty();
}
来源：力扣(LeetCode)
```

**Complexity:** *Time:* O(1), *Space:* O(1)

###### 4. Peek

The `front` element is kept in constant memory and is modified when we push or pop an element.

```java
// Get the front element.
public int peek() {
  return front;
}
```

**Complexity:** *Time:* O(1), *Space:* O(1)

#### Method 2

###### 1. Push

The newly arrived element is always added on the top of stack `s1` and the first element is kept as `front` queue element.

![](https://leetcode.com/media/original_images/232_queue_using_stacksAPush.png)

```java
private Stack<Integer> s1 = new Stack<>();
private Stack<Integer> s2 = new Stack<>();

// Push element x to the back of queue.
public void push(int x) {
    if (s1.empty())
        front = x;
    s1.push(x);
}
```

**Complexity:** *Time:* O(1), *Space:* O(n)

###### 2. Pop

We have to remove element in front of the queue. This is the first inserted element in the stack `s1` and it is positioned at the bottom of the stack because of stack's LIFO policy. To remove the bottom element from `s1`, we have to pop all elements from `s1` and to push them on to an additional stack `s2`, which helps us to store the elements of `s1` in reversed order. This way the bottom elemnt of `s1` will be positioned on top of `s2` and we can simply pop it from stack `s2`. Once `s2` is empty, the algorithm transfer data from `s1` to `s2` again.

![](https://leetcode.com/media/original_images/232_queue_using_stacksAPop.png)

```java
// Removes the element from in front of queue.
public void pop() {
    if (s2.isEmpty()) {
        while (!s1.isEmpty())
            s2.push(s1.pop());
    }
    s2.pop();    
}
```

**Complexity:** *Time:* O(1) / O(N), *Space:* O(1)

###### 3. Empty

Both stack `s1` and `s2` contain all stack elements, so the algorithm checks `s1` and `s2` size to return if the queue is empty.

```java
// Return whether the queue is empty.
public boolean empty() {
    return s1.isEmpty() && s2.isEmpty();
}
```

**Complexity:** *Time:* O(1), *Space:* O(1)

###### 4. Peek

The `front` element is kept in constant memory and is modified when we push an element. When `s2` is not empty, front element is positioned on the top of `s2`.

```java
// Get the front element.
public int peek() {
    if (!s2.isEmpty()) {
            return s2.peek();
    }
    return front;
}
```

**Complexity:** *Time:* O(1), *Space:* O(1)
