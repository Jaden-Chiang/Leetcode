# 0. Dynamic Programming

> *Reference: Intro to Algorithms*

Dynamic programming, like the divide-and-conquer method, solves problem by combining the solutions to subproblems. ("Programming" in this context refers to a tabular method, not to writing computer code.) Dynamic programming applies when the subproblems overlap -- that is, when subproblems share subsubproblems. A dynamic-programming algorithm solves each subsubproblem just once and then saves its answer in a table, thereby avoiding the work of recomputing the answer every time it solves each subsubproblem.

We typically apply dynamic programming to ***optimization problems***. Such problems can have many possible solutions. Each solution has a value, and we wish to find a solution with the optimal (minimum or maximum) value. We call such a solution *an* optimal solution to the problem, as opposed to *the* optimal solution, since there may be several solutions that achieve the optimal value.

When developing a dynamic-programming algorithm, we follow a sequence of four steps:

1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.
2. Recursively define the value of an optimal solution.
3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion.
4. Construct an optimal solution from computed informaiton.
