[CDII]: https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/contains-duplicate-ii/	"Contains Duplicate II"

**Difficulty:** `easy`

**Tag:** `Array` / `Hash Table`

------

### **Question**

Given an array of integers and an integer *k*, find out whether there are two distinct indices *i* and *j* in the array such that **nums[i] = nums[j]** and the **absolute** difference between *i* and *j* is at most *k*.

------

### **Method**

#### Method 1 -- Linear Search

Compare each element with the *k* elements after it to check if they are equal.

##### Reference Code (omission)

##### Own Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean containsNearbyDuplicate(int[] nums, int k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i+1; j < i+k+1 && j<nums.length; j++) {
                if (nums[i] == nums[j]){
                    return true;}}}
        return false;}}
```

#### Method 2 -- Binary Search Tree (BST)

We could maintain a sliding window of size *k*. This algorithm's core is reducing time of traversing *k* elements in *Method_1*. Considering about using a mre complex data structure to maintain the order in this *k*-sized sliding window. The elements in this window strictly abide by first in first out, so queue is easiest we could think out. Linked list has a constant time to `delete`, `input`, but has a linear time to `search`. And queue is not better than *Method_1*.

A better choice is using Binary Search Tree (BST). By using it, `search`, `delete` and `input` could have a time complexity -- O(log*k*), *k* is the number of elements in BST. Usually, we needn't create a BST by ourselves. In Java, we could use `TreeSet` or `TreeMap`.

Assume we already had a BST, the fake codes are as follows:

- Traverse array, for each element:
  - `Search` element in BST, if it could be find, return *true`.
  - `Input` current element in BST.
  - If current size of BST is more than *k*, delete the olddest element.
- Return *false*.

```java
public boolean containsNearbyDuplicate(int[] nums, int k) {
    Set<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
        if (set.contains(nums[i])) return true;
        set.add(nums[i]);
        if (set.size() > k) {
            set.remove(nums[i - k]);
        }
    }
    return false;
}

##### Complexity

- *Time Complexity:* O(Nlog(min(*k*,n)))
- *Space Complexity:* O(min(n,*k*))

#### Method 3 -- Hash Set

We also coule use hash set to maintain this *k*-sized sliding window.

Hash set as a data structure, could `search`, `delete`, `input` elements in constant time. This method is as *Method_2*, it's steps are as follows:

- Traverse array, for each element:
  - `Search` current element in hash set, return *true* when find it.
  - `Input` current element in hash set.
  - If hash set's size is more than *k*, then delete the olddest element.
- Return *false*.

```java
public boolean containsNearbyDuplicate(int[] nums, int k) {
    Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();//Knowledge_1
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
        if (set.contains(nums[i])) return true;
        set.add(nums[i]);
        if (set.size() > k) {
            set.remove(nums[i - k]);
        }
    }
    return false;
}
