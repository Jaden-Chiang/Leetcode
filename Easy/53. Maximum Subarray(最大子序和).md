**Difficulty:** `easy`

**Tag:** `Array` / `Divide and Conquer` / `Dynamic Programming`

### **Question**

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return *its sum*.

**Follow up:** If you have figuted out the `O(N)` solution, try coding another solution  using the **divide and conquer** approach, which is more subtle(精妙).

### **Method**

#### Method 1 -- Violent enumeration

The reference answer doesn't ues this method, because in this question, its time compexity is too high. But it still a method.

Obviously, violent enumeration needs to get all of array's subarray to find out maximum sum.

##### Own Code

```java
    public static int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int max = nums[0];
        for (int n : nums) {
            if (n > max) {
                max = n;
            }
        } // Remark_1
        int sum = nums[0];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] <= 0) {
                continue;
            } else {
                sum = nums[i];
                for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                    if (sum + nums[j] > max) {
                        max = sum + nums[j];
                    }
                    sum += nums[j];
                }
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
```

*Remark_1: This loop gets the maximum element in the array. Without it, the `[-2,1]` will return result `[1]`*.

#### Method 2 -- Dynamic programming

Dynamic programming, like the divide-and-conquer method, solves problems by combining the solutions to subproblems. However, dynamic programming applies when the subproblems overlap -- that is, when subproblems share subsubpeoblems.

We typically apply dynamic programming to ***optimizaiton problems***. Such problems can have many possible solutions. Each solution has a value, and we wish to find a solution with the optimal (minimum or maximum) value. We call such a solution *an* optimal solution to the problem, as opposed to *the* optimal solution, since there may be seversal solutions that achieve the optimal value.

When developing a dynamic-programming algorithm, we follow a sequence of four steps:

1. Charactize the structure of an optimal solution.
2. Recursively(递归地) difine the value of an optimal solution.
3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion.
4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information.

Steps 1-3 form the basis of a dynamic-programming solution to a problem. If we need only the value of an optimal solution, and not the solution itself, then we can omit step 4.

In this case, we can use the following steps:

**1. Charactize the structure of an optimal solution:** Suppose the length of array is `n`,  and the subscript is form `0` to `n-1`. We use *ai* to represent `nums[i]`, use *f(i)* to represent the *"maximum sum of consecutive subarrasy"* ending with the i-th number. Obviously, the answer we want to get is
$$
{max \choose 0 \leq i \leq n-1}{f(i)}
$$
So we only need to find out *f(i)* at each position, then return the maximum in `array f`.

**2. Recursively difine the value of an optimal solution:** Now, the question is how to compute `f(i)`. We can consider whether let `ai` plus to `f(i-1)`. It depends on which is bigger between `ai` and `ai + f(i-1)`. So we can get the dynamic-programming equation
$$
f(i)=  max\{f(i-1)+a_i,a_i\}
$$
It easy to get a solution with time complexity O(N) and space complexity O(N), that is, use an array `f` to store the value of `f(i)`, and use a loop to find maximum of `f(i)`. But considering that `f(i)` is only related to `f(i-1)`, so we can use a variable `pre` to maintain the value of `f(i-1)` and `f(i)`, thereby reducing the space complexity to O(1), which is similar to *rolling array(滚动数组)*.

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int pre = 0, maxAns = nums[0];
        for (int x : nums) {
            pre = Math.max(pre + x, x);
            maxAns = Math.max(maxAns, pre);
        }
        return maxAns;
    }
}

##### Own Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums){
        int[] fi = new int[nums.length];//Remark_1
        fi[0] = nums[0];
        int max = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            fi[i] = Math.max(fi[i-1]+nums[i],nums[i]);
            max = Math.max(max,fi[i]);// use Math package
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

*Remark_1: Use a array to store `f` is waste space, we can learn the method in Reference Code.*

##### Complexity

- *Time Complexity:* O(N)
- *Space Complexity:* O(1)

#### Method 3 -- Divide and Conquer

Recall that in divide-and-conquer, we solve a problem recursively, applying three steps at each level of the recursion:

**Divide** the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.

**Conquer** the subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, just solve the subproblems in a straightforward manner.

**Combine** the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.

when the subproblems are large enough to solve recursively, we call the ***recursive case***. Once the subproblems become small enough that we no longer recurse, we say that the recursion "bottoms out"(触底) and that we have gotten down to the ***base case***. Sometimes, in addition to subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problems, we have to solve subproblems that are not quite the same as the original problem. We consider solving such subproblems as part of the combine step.

In this case, we can solve problems as follows:

We define a method `get(a,l,r)` to find the maximum subarray sum in *[l,r]* of array *a*, so the answer we want to get is `get(nums, 0, nums.length()-1)`. The question is how could we use divide-and-conquer to achieve this opration. for an interval *[l,r]*, we take `m` as *(1+r)/2*, and use divide-and-conquer in interval *[l,m]* and *[m+l,r]*. When the recursion deepens layer by layer until the interval length is reduced to *1*, the recursion "bottoms out". And now, we should consider combine the informations between interval *[l,m]* and interval *[m+1,r]* to get the information of interval *[l,r]*. The two most important questions are:

- What informations should we maintain?
- How could we conbine these informations?

We could maintain four parameters in an interval:

- `lSum` represents the maximum subinterval sum with `l` as the left end point in *[l,r]*.
- `rSum` represents the maximum subinterval sum with `r` as the right end point in *[l,r]*.
- `mSum` represents the maximum subinterval sum.
- `iSum` represnets the subinterval sum.

The abbreviation *[l,m]* is the "left subinterval" of *[l,r]*, the abbreviation *[m+1,r]* is the "right subinterval" of *[l,r]*. For the subinterval *[i,i]* which length is *1*, the four parameters are equal to *ai*. For the subinterval which length is more than *1*:

- `iSum` is the easiest to maintain. `iSum` of *[l,r]* is equal `iSum` of left subinterval plus `iSum` of right subinterval.

- `lSum` of *[l,r]* has two possible, it equals `lSum` of left subinterval or `iSum` of left interval plus `lSum` of right subinterval.

- `rSum` is same to `lSum`, it equals `rSum` of right subinterval or `iSum` of right interval plus `rSum` of left interval.

- After conputing three parametes above, it is easy to compute `mSum` of *[l,r]*. We chould consider `mSum` of *[l,r]* whether including *m* or not. If it doesn't conclude *m*, that is, `mSum` of *[l,r]* may be one of `mSum` between left and right subinterval. If it concludes *m*, it may equal `rSum` of left subinterval plus `lSum` of right subinterval.

    public class Status {
        public int lSum, rSum, mSum, iSum;

        public Status(int lSum, int rSum, int mSum, int iSum) {
            this.lSum = lSum;
            this.rSum = rSum;
            this.mSum = mSum;
            this.iSum = iSum;
        }
    }

    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        return getInfo(nums, 0, nums.length - 1).mSum;
    }

    public Status getInfo(int[] a, int l, int r) {
        if (l == r) {
            return new Status(a[l], a[l], a[l], a[l]);
        }
        int m = (l + r) >> 1; //Remark_1
        Status lSub = getInfo(a, l, m);
        Status rSub = getInfo(a, m + 1, r);
        return pushUp(lSub, rSub);
    }

    public Status pushUp(Status l, Status r) {
        int iSum = l.iSum + r.iSum;
        int lSum = Math.max(l.lSum, l.iSum + r.lSum);
        int rSum = Math.max(r.rSum, r.iSum + l.rSum);
        int mSum = Math.max(Math.max(l.mSum, r.mSum), l.rSum + r.lSum);
        return new Status(lSum, rSum, mSum, iSum);
    }
}

*Remark_1: The signed shift operator "<<" shifts a bit pattern to the left, and the signed right shift operator ">>" shifts a bit pattern to the right. The bit pattern is given by the left-hand operand, and the number of positions to shift by the right-hand operand. The unsigned right shift operator ">>>" shifts a zero into the leftmost position, while the leftmost position after ">>" depends on sigh extension. For example:*

```java
5 >> 1
output: 101 --> 10 (5 --> 2)
12 >> 1
output: 1100 --> 110 (12 --> 6)
```

*The signed shift operator "<<" can play the role of multiplying by 2, and ">>" can be used to divided by 2. (It is because the index of 2 shifted backward). The benifit of using signed shift operator is it faster than  arithmetic operation.*

*The underlying algorithm of division is shown in the figure:*

- *Space Complexity:* O(logN)

#### Method 4 -- Greedy Algorithms

Algorithms for optimization problems typically go though a sequence of steps, with a set of choices at each step. For many optimization problems, using dynamics programming to determine the best choices is overkill; simpler, more efficent algorithms will do. A ***greedy algorithm*** always makes the choice that looks best at the moment. That is, <u>it makes a locally optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally optimal provide optimal solutions.</u> 

In this case, the greedy algorithm could be concluded in a sentence: If sum of elements before current pointer is less than *0*, then throw the array which before current element.

##### Own Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int preSum = nums[0];
        int maxSum = nums[0];
        int curSum = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (preSum<0){
                curSum = preSum = nums[i];
            }else{
                curSum = nums[i]+preSum;
                preSum = curSum;
            }
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum,curSum);
        }
        return maxSum;
    }
}
```

##### Complexity

- *Time Complexity:* O(N)
- *Space Complexity:* O(1)

> **Review On**: This question has four methods to solve. And the greedy algorithm may be the best among them. Learning all of four methods costs a lot of time, but I think it deserved.
