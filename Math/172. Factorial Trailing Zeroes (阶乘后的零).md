## Question

Given an integer `n`, return *the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`*.

------

## Method

We could use violent calculation, and in *Java*, we could use ***BigInteger*** to prevent data overflow. However, this method is too slow, we could use following methods.

#### Method 1 -- Calculate Factor 5

We could recognize that each 0 at the end of the factorial means multiplying by 10. So, how many times do we multiply 10 in calculating `n!`? Multiply two numbers `a` and `b`, such as 42 * 75 = 3150, we could rewrite as follows:

42 = 2 * 3 * 7

75 = 3 * 5 * 5

42 * 75 = 2 * 3 * 7 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 5

Now, to determine how many zeros there are at the end, we should calculate how many pairs of 2 and 5. In example above, we have a pair of 2 and 5, so there are only one zero at the end. According to this thought, we could simply our calculation, we only need to calculate how many pairs of 2 and 5 in the `n!`.

For example, in the `16!`, number 5, 10 and 15 include factor 5, and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 include factor 2. Because there are only three pairs, so there are three zeros at the end of `16!`.

This could solve many problems, however, some numbers have more than one factors, for example, 25 has two factors 5. So we should use a *while* loop instead of *for* loop. Divide each number by 5 until its remainder doesn't have factor 5.

In this way, we could get answer, but we could still make some improvements. First, we realize that factor 2 is always more than factor 5. As following picture shows:

So, we could omit the process of calculating factor 2.

Finally, we analysis each number from 1 to n, however, only 5, 10, 15, 20... has factor 5. So we could iterate five number each time.

##### Reference Code

```java
public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        
    int zeroCount = 0;
    for (int i = 5; i <= n; i += 5) {
        int currentFactor = i;
        while (currentFactor % 5 == 0) {
            zeroCount++;
            currentFactor /= 5;
        }
    }
    return zeroCount;
}

##### Complexity

- *Time Complexity:* O(N)
- *Space Complexity:* O(1)

#### Method 2 -- Calculate Factor 5 Efficiently

In Method 1, we calculate amount of factor 5 in multiples of 5. But it still too slow and we need to improve it.

Thinking about previous simply algorithm (although it's not correct because some number have more than one factor 5). We will find it is an inefficient method. Due to we only care about multiples of 5 and omit others, so we could simply codes as `fives = n / 5`. And for numbers have more than one factor 5 such as 25, 125..., we could use `n/25` to calculate again. Now, the result is `fives = n/5 + n/25`. And so on, we also need to calculate `n/125, n/625...`. When denominator bigger than n, the result will be 0, and it's time to stop.

In the codes, we could use power of 5 to calculate.

##### Reference Code

```java
public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
    int zeroCount = 0;
    // We need to use long because currentMultiple can potentially become
    // larger than an int.
    long currentMultiple = 5;
    while (n >= currentMultiple) {
        zeroCount += (n / currentMultiple);
        currentMultiple *= 5;
    }
    return zeroCount;
}
