## Question

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

------

## Method

The ***inorder tree walk*** of the BST is an ascending sequence, in this case, sorted array be given is the ***inorder tree walk*** of the BST.

If we only have this sorted array, we can't uniquely determine the binary search tree. Because without requiring height balanced, any number could be used as the root node of the BST, so there are multiple possible BST.

However, if we require this BST is height balanced, there are still multiple possible BST.

Intuitively, we could choose the middle number of as the root node of the BST, so that the number of nodes in left and right subtree is same or differs by *1* (it could keep the tree's height balanced). If the length of tree is odd, the root node is unique. Otherwise, we could choose the number on the left or right of the middle position as the root node. Different choice will creates different BST.

After we determine the root node, other numbers are located in the left and right subtrees of the balanced BST. And the left and right subtree are also balanced BST, so we could create them recursively.

In the case of given an *inorder tree walk* sorted array, the number in each subtree must be continuous in the array. Thus, we could ensure numbers in the subtree by their indexes. For the entire *inorder tree walk* sequence, the index is from `0` to `nums.length-1`. The BST is empty when array has nothing.

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums) {
        return helper(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
    }

    public TreeNode helper(int[] nums, int left, int right) {
        if (left > right) {
            return null;
        }

        // 总是选择中间位置右边的数字作为根节点
        int mid = (left + right + 1) / 2;
        // 总是选择中间位置左边的数字作为根节点
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;
        // 选择任意一个中间位置数字作为根节点
        int mid = (left + right + rand.nextInt(2)) / 2;

        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
        root.left = helper(nums, left, mid - 1);
        root.right = helper(nums, mid + 1, right);
        return root;
    }
}
