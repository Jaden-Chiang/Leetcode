## Question

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

## Method

#### Method 1 -- Recursive

A tree is symmetric if the left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree.

Therefore, the question is: when are two trees a mirror reflection of each other? Two trees are a mirror reflection of each other if:

1. Their two roots have the same value.
2. The right subtree of each tree is a mirror reflection of the left subtree of the other tree.

We could implement such a recursive function: Traversing this tree by ***synchronous movement***(同步移动) two pointers `p` and `q`. `p` and `q` are point to the root at beginning, and then, when `p` moves to the right, `q` moves to the left, and when `p` moves to the left, `q` moves to the right. Check each time whether the values of current node `p` and `q` are equal, if it is, then determine whether their left and right subtrees are symmetric.

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode root) {
        return check(root, root);
    }

    public boolean check(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (p == null && q == null) {
            return true;
        }
        if (p == null || q == null) {
            return false;
        }
        return p.val == q.val && check(p.left, q.right) && check(p.right, q.left);
    }
}

##### Complexity

- *Time Complexity:* O(N)
- *Space Complexity:* O(N)

#### Method 2 -- Iterative

Instead of recursion, we could also iteration with the aid of a **queue**. Each two consecutive(连续的) nodes in the queue should be equal, and their subtrees a mirror of each other. Initially, the queue contains `root` and `root`. Then the algorithm works similarly to Breadth-First-Search, with some key differences. Each time, two nodes are extracted and their values compared. The the right and left children of the two nodes are inserted in the queue in opposite order. The algorithm is done when either the queue is empty, or we detect that tree is not symmetric.

##### Reference Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode root) {
        return check(root, root);
    }

    public boolean check(TreeNode u, TreeNode v) {
        //Knowledge
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<TreeNode>();
        q.offer(u);
        q.offer(v);
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            u = q.poll();
            v = q.poll();
            if (u == null && v == null) {
                continue;
            }
            if ((u == null || v == null) || (u.val != v.val)) {
                return false;
            }

            q.offer(u.left);
            q.offer(v.right);

            q.offer(u.right);
            q.offer(v.left);
        }
        return true;}}

### Knowledge

#### Queue Interface in Java

The ***Queue*** interface present in the **java.util** package and extends the **Collection interface** is used to hold the elements about to be processed in First-In-First-Out order.

Being an interface the queue needs a concrete class for the declaration and the most common classes are the ***PriorityQueue*** and ***LinkedList*** in java.

`Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>()`

#####  `q.add(e)`

Inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do so immediately without violating capacity restrictions, return `true` upon success and throwing an IllegalStateException if no space is currently avaliable.

##### `q.offer(e)`

Inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do so immediately without violating capacity restrictions. When using a capacity-restricted queue, this method is **generally preferable to add**(E), which can fail to insert an element only by throwing an exception

***The difference between `add` and `offer` is: If no space is currently avaliable, `add` will throws a exception while `offer` won't.***

##### `q.remove()`

Retrieves and remove the head of this queue. This method differs from `poll` only in that it **throws an exception if this queue is empty**.

##### `q.poll()`

Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or returns `null` if this queue is empty

##### `q.element()`

Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue. This method differs from `peek` only in that it throws an exception if this queue is empty.

##### `q.peek()`

Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue, or returns `null` if this queue is empty.

> Use **offer**, **poll** and **peek** is better.
