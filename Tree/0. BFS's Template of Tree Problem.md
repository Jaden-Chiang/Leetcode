# 0. BFS's Template of Tree Problem

**Reference:** https://blog.csdn.net/fuxuemingzhu/article/details/101900729

Most of problems about binary tree could use DFS or BFS to solve.

BFS is traverse layer by layer, DFS is walk to bottom and then traverse back.

## BFS

***BFS*** uses *Queue* to add every nodes in the queue successively. And then pop the head element as the current traverse point. There are two templates of BFS:

1. If we don't need to ensure which layer we are traversing, we could use template as follows.

```java
while (! queue.isEmpty()){
	TreeNode tn = queue.poll();
	if (tn satisfies conditions){
		//operation
		//might need
		queue.offer(root.left);
		queue.offer(root.right);
	}else{
		//operation
		//might need
		queue.offer(root.left);
		queue.offer(root.right);
	}
}
```

2. If we need to record the layer which we are traversing, we could create a parameter `level` to record layer. And parameter `size` represents the number of nodes in current layer. We have traversed all nodes in current layer when `size == 0`.

```java
int level = 0;
while (! queue.isEmpty()){
	size = queue.size();
	while (size > 0){
		TreeNode tn = queue.poll();
		if (tn satisfies conditions){
			//operation
			//might need
			queue.offer(root.left);
			queue.offer(root.right);
		}else{
			//operation
			//might need
			queue.offer(root.left);
			queue.offer(root.right);
		}
		size --;
	}
    level ++;
}
```
